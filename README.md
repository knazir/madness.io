## Development Environment Setup

Make sure you have [node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) installed first. You can then run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the dependencies you need to run the app locally.


## Starting the Server

After setting up your development environment, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The site should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
Any changes you make to `server.js` will be available on refresh without needing to restart the server.


## Style Linter
Before creating a pull request, run:
```bash
npm run lint
```
Once the style linter reports no errors, open a pull request with your changes!
